# Worldwide_Happiness_Report-data-visualation

this is **UCD COMP40610 Information Visualation** final project.

the origin data comes from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techslides/D3-Maps/master/data/world/world-110m.json.

1. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness contains 2015-2019 world happiness dataset. we select country, rank, happiness scores, economic scores and health scroes features from 5 datasets. And then combine them into one dataset by adding a feature called 'year'.What's more we set an extra feature called states to label these countries' states.

2. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techslides/D3-Maps/master/data/world/world-110m.json is a map dataset for displaying the worldwide map. It contains country name feature.So,I can do the map matching with this dataset.

the authors are **LFX(Feixiang Liu)** (clean the data and make three pictures at present)and **Niko(Shuhao Guan)**(do the gdp, health and score relationships.)

At present we create four interactive pictures to observe distribution of the Worldwide Happiness Scores of countries and states.

In the future, we  hope to explore more relations among GDP, Health, and Happiness.
